# Spotibot

Spotibot is a Java-based music bot that allows users to play and manage audio tracks seamlessly. This bot can be run locally or deployed on a server, providing a robust solution for music streaming and scheduling.

# Project Setup and Compilation Guide

## Requirements
This project requires the following tools:
- **Maven** (build tool)
- **Java 17 JDK** (Java Development Kit)
- **YT-DLP**

## Compilation and Running the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Bots
```

### Step 2: Build the Project
Use Maven to clean and build the project:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Step 3: Run the Project
Execute the generated JAR file. If you have multiple JDK versions installed, explicitly run with JDK 17:
```bash
<path-to-jdk-17>/bin/java -jar target/spotibot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

For example, if you installed JDK 17 via Chocolatey:
```bash
C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\openjdk17\bin\java -jar target/spotibot-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Configuration

The bot requires a `config.json` file in the `bots` directory. You can create this file manually or use the provided script.

### Example `config.json`
```json
{
  "bot_token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
